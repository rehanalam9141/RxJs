      <p class="lead">RxJS is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences. 
        It provides one core type, the Observable, satellite types (Observer, Schedulers, Subjects) and operators inspired 
        by Array methods (map, filter, reduce, every, etc) to allow handling asynchronous events as collections.</p>
